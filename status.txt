Project is started.
The high resolution build of the OpenFlexure part is about 80% completed. https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/build
Some ordered parts did not arrive yet so one axis movement is not possbile yet. That is not a problemfor testing as the movement can be done via the CNC motor.
The sample holders design is done for the Petri Dish plate holder - should be available under models
The attachment to the bed is not started yet not completed
The CNC is present and modification started
The assemble could be verified manually by running a specific Gcode that scans the plates one by one however there is no connection between the microscope electronics and CNC
Still TODO
The bracket that mounts the microscope to the spindle holder has not been designed
The new CNC board software has not been customized
The new CNC board software has not been extended to connect to the microscope electronics
