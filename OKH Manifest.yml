title: Multi target microscopy
description: A high resolution automated microscope that can monitor multiple targets like
  for instance 10 Petri dishes
intended-use: |-
  Used to take high resolution images or videos of targets.
  The targets could be any small areas that need to be analyzed.
  Initial use is to analyze and compare cells placed in ten Petri dishes. 
  It can be used to optimize production of biologics
  It can be used to analyze response to antibiotics like in a AST assay.
